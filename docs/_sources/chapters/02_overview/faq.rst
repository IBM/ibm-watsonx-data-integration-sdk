FAQ
~~~

1. What is the IBM watsonx.data integration Python SDK?
--------------------------------------------------------

The Python SDK is a developer-first interface that allows data engineers and developers to build, manage, and deploy IBM watsonx.data integration data flows entirely in code. It exposes Python methods for flows, jobs, environments, and configurations, making it easy to embed integration workflows into CI/CD and automation practices.

2. Who is this SDK for?
------------------------

The SDK is designed for data engineers, integration developers, and platform administrators who prefer a programmatic interface for data integration workflows or have a need to automate ETL, ELT, batch, and streaming flows. DevOps engineers and platform leaders can also take advantage of the SDK to improve scalability, governance, and operational efficiency in hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

3. Why would a customer use this instead of the existing UI?
-------------------------------------------------------------

While the UI is useful for design and monitoring, the SDK removes manual overhead and enables data flows to be defined as code. This provides reproducibility, easier integration into CI/CD, and faster delivery.

4. What are the main use cases?
--------------------------------

* Managing integration flows and jobs as code.
* Automating repetitive deployment tasks.
* Embedding data integration into DevOps pipelines.
* Scaling data integration workflows across hybrid and multi-cloud data environments.
* Supporting governance and compliance with reproducible configurations.


5. How does this improve developer productivity?
-------------------------------------------------

The SDK reduces time-to-deploy by automating routine tasks, eliminating manual errors, and allowing pipelines to be version controlled. This frees developers to focus on optimization, analytics, and innovation.

6. How is IBM different from competitors here?
-----------------------------------------------

Unlike Informatica, Matillion, Fivetran or cloud-native tools that provide fragmented APIs, IBM offers a unified SDK that spans multiple integration products, supports hybrid and multi-cloud, and embeds enterprise-grade governance, security, and in the future AI-assisted capabilities.

7. What is required to adopt the SDK?
--------------------------------------

Adoption mainly requires developers to become familiar with Python and integrate the SDK into existing automation frameworks. No new infrastructure is needed beyond an existing IBM integration deployment.

8. What does it cost?
----------------------

The SDK is included at no additional cost for customers licensed for the underlying IBM integration products. API usage follows platform entitlements.

9. Where can developers get started?
--------------------------------------

Developers will find documentation, tutorials, and code samples in IBM watsonx.data integration documentation :doc:`here <../01_welcome/prereqs>`. Webinars, blogs, and community forums will also showcase use cases, best practices, and how to get started guides. To learn how to build flows, use the Python flow generator to take an existing flow and generate the corresponding SDK code to rebuild the flow to learn syntax and structure of the data integration Python SDK.

10. What are common misconceptions or limitations?
---------------------------------------------------

Some may expect the SDK to generate pipelines automatically or use AI to design flows. The SDK focuses on programmatic access and automation of existing capabilities. Designing optimal workflows still requires knowledge of IBM's watsonx.data integration tools.

11. What is the long-term vision?
----------------------------------

The SDK will evolve into the unified developer interface for IBM’s full data integration suite, with AI-assisted pipeline creation, observability, pipeline orchestration and unstructured data integration.

12. What data integration software versions is this SDK compatible with?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

See full list of compatible software products :doc:`here <../01_welcome/supported_products>`.
